half addder

bit 1 : a xor b
bit 2: a and b

full addder

half adder a and b

half adder bit 1 of result with c
or the result of the 2 second bits

bit 1: (a xor b) xor c == a xor b xor c
bit 2: (a and b) or ((a xor b) and c)

to add 2 numbers

half adder the least significant bits
use the sum as value for the least signiicant bit of the result
use the carry to perform a full adder with the next significant bits 

therefore 

therefore x00 xor y00 -> z00
(x01 xor y01) xor (x00 and y00) -> z01
(x02 xor y02) xor (x01 and y01) or ((x01 xor y01) and (x00 and y00)) -> z02
